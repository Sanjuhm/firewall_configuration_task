# How Firewalls Filter Traffic

A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined rules.

- **Inbound Rules**: Control traffic coming into the computer from the network.
- **Outbound Rules**: Control traffic going from the computer to the network.
- **Port-based Filtering**: Blocks or allows network connections based on port numbers (e.g., 22 for SSH, 23 for Telnet).
- **Protocol-based Filtering**: Uses protocols like TCP or UDP for more specific filtering.

**Summary of This Demo:**
- We blocked port 23 to deny Telnet connections.
- We removed the block to restore the original firewall state.
